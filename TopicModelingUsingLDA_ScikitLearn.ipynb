              "This particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application. I highly recommend you generate verification that Credit Union has been reported completely in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulations, it's really a serious problem to misreport. More confirmation of the aforesaid item too.

              "My wife and I were solicited by XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America XXXX for a better rate with potential of thousands in savings and the best ever rate on our Home Equity Loan. She promised an smooth fast and solid experience, but instead, Bank of America after running our credit reports ( mine with the wrong last name ) without our consent and without even going through the documentation they refused the loan. \\nIn addition, XXXX XXXX boss XXXX XXXX XXXX requested that I have to provide reports from all three credit bureaus and he is playing hard ball. Never even apologized, and tried to blame my credit retreval failure to the freeze of my credit account ( my wife 's account has a freeze too, but were able to obtain her credit score-attached, XXXX never disclosed anything about removing a freeze and we were not there anyway, never signed any documents to approve anything ). \\nI personally feel that I was discriminated and I can see that there is a conflict of interest giving us the opportunity to save money. We never missed a payment, and we have multiple accounts with Bank of America, and this is not the first time we believe that we have been discriminated. \\nWe feel they were never intended to approve our application, although our credit is excellent, and we have a lot of equity in our home. There is no absolutely any excuse to deny our application. According to XXXX XXXX, our savings just up to end of XXXX would be about {$1000.00}, but instead we funded 2 monthly payments so far of approx. {$3000.00}.

              "Refinanced to Amerihome in XX/XX/2019. Did not receive welcome packet, account details, even was given the wrong account information. DO NOT USE AMERIHOME! \\n\\nXXXX. mortgage payment was deferred due to refinancing. \\n\\nPay XXXX payment over the phone with a representative, paid the {$10.00} servicing fee, and was corrected on the account number issued to me being inaccurate. \\n\\nPaid XXXX over the phone, because online platform was clunky, showed loan unavailable because the account number did not match ( the old one or the new one ). I had still had not received welcome packet/payment coupons. Set up Online playform, connecting the right loan and name together with a representative on the phone. Attempted, and believed successful, at setting up Auto-Pay. Auto-paid failed for XXXX causing the cascade of \" I hate this company '' Tried to pay XXXX and XXXX in full before XXXX XXXX. Bank returned payment, due to unable to find the account. Was notified on XXXX XXXX after both XXXX and XXXX payments late, was NOT notified on their online system ; no email, no text message, nothing! Did show that my payment had been kicked back from my bank \" unable to locate account ''. \\n\\nI attempted to pay a 2nd time, in XXXX XXXX, paid with a different bank ( troubleshooting why the 1st bank rejected ) ; 2nd bank returned payment due to account errors. Now It said my account was over 30  days late, because both my banks had returned payments, I was unable to pay online, or with a representative ; had to pay with a wire transfer- are you kidding me?! I was spending my lunches as a XXXX XXXX trying to figure why I couldn't pay my mortgage, why the servicing department was having issues and inaccuracies with my account. \\n\\nIn XXXX found out the surname on the account was incomplete/misspelled, after XXXX XXXX payment was rejected from my 2nd bank. Even now, I can see in my online system where my name is misspelled in their system. \\n\\nHave called Amerihome twice a month since XXXX to get this sorted ; has caused over 100 points of credit damage. Of a company of 115 employees, I have talked to 20 of them, including direct correspondence with people in the HQ office. Every person I have talked to has given me the run-around, put blame on me since they see their accounts are not misspelled ( but I can see on my online platform it CLEARLY is ). I have had 2 managers tell me they put in the request to get the XXXX phone calls listened to ; which I believe is MY proof that the Auto-Pay set up was a folly on AmeriHome 's part, and is the antecedent to the last four months of misery ; when I talked to the representative at HQ in XXXX, there was no note that either manager had put in the request ( 1st was in XX/XX/XXXX was in XXXX. ). THEY ARE GOING TO LIE TO YOU. \\n\\nAccount was paid in full for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX before XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThis servicing company has caused me much headache for ME trying to solve THEIR servicing issues.

I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back.

On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX @ XXXX  XXXX XXXX  in XXXX XXXX South Carolina I went in and opened another account. The manager of that store also told me that I no longer had an account and I would have to re-apply. I reapplied and received a limit this time of {$1000.00}. I spent {$560.00}. XXXX of the {$1000.00}. The first mistake is XXXX never sent me a bill to make my first payment. The second mistake is that I went into the XXXX @ XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Maryland on XX/XX/XXXX and bought {$200.00} dollars worth of jewelry and then got a bill from two different credit card company saying that they were kay jewelers which was XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. When calling both companies, I was told that I had to pay them both, but it was impossible because I used the XXXX account # that XXXX XXXX   gave. So I disputed, there was no previous XXXX account on my credit report and according to XXXX XXXX, all in store cards were sold, and didn't report and mine was a in store card and a account that had been paid off and closed out before. As soon as I made noise and disputed with both companies, no one knew what I was speaking account so I reported both accounts as fraud. I have no problem paying what I owe but will only pay what I owe. A supervisor from kay jewelers called and let me know that they would start and investigation in to the account andn let me know the account but in the mean time, halt everything, so I haled payments. The other company told me the same thing. XXXX swears this account was opened i XXXX of XXXX, when it was opened in XXXX of XXXX, they are reporting 10 missed payments, and XXXX  is reporting 5 missed payments, I never missed anything becuase no one could figure out what was going on, it was XXXX XXXX issue putting me on 2 different accounts, not mine, This issue went on for months, and we finallly resolved it with XXXX XXXX and paid what was past due. But instead of taking the lates off because of the fraud issue as they prmised, they put more on there and decreased my limit to XXXX. My credit is important to me, and these lates are bring my score down drastically because they had 2 finance companies and though no one would figure it out.

They bypassed any means to communicate and resolve the issue but reported me. \\nWouldn't it be reasonable to ask why they did not try to reach me? \\nI understand they send statements in emails but I have not received any emails with regards to this situation from them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ...

On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX @ XXXX  XXXX XXXX  in XXXX XXXX South Carolina I went in and opened another account. The manager of that store also told me that I no longer had an account and I would have to re-apply. I reapplied and received a limit this time of {$1000.00}. I spent {$560.00}. XXXX of the {$1000.00}. The first mistake is XXXX never sent me a bill to make my first payment. The second mistake is that I went into the XXXX @ XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Maryland on XX/XX/XXXX and bought {$200.00} dollars worth of jewelry and then got a bill from two different credit card company saying that they were kay jewelers which was XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. When calling both companies, I was told that I had to pay them both, but it was impossible because I used the XXXX account # that XXXX XXXX   gave. So I disputed, there was no previous XXXX account on my credit report and according to XXXX XXXX, all in store cards were sold, and didn't report and mine was a in store card and a account that had been paid off and closed out before. As soon as I made noise and disputed with both companies, no one knew what I was speaking account so I reported both accounts as fraud. I have no problem paying what I owe but will only pay what I owe. A supervisor from kay jewelers called and let me know that they would start and investigation in to the account andn let me know the account but in the mean time, halt everything, so I haled payments. The other company told me the same thing. XXXX swears this account was opened i XXXX of XXXX, when it was opened in XXXX of XXXX, they are reporting 10 missed payments, and XXXX  is reporting 5 missed payments, I never missed anything becuase no one could figure out what was going on, it was XXXX XXXX issue putting me on 2 different accounts, not mine, This issue went on for months, and we finallly resolved it with XXXX XXXX and paid what was past due. But instead of taking the lates off because of the fraud issue as they prmised, they put more on there and decreased my limit to XXXX. My credit is important to me, and these lates are bring my score down drastically because they had 2 finance companies and though no one would figure it out. I need the late pays for both companies taken off of my report please.  ...  STERLING JEWELERS, INC.               \n",
